- The `StandardScaler()` module from `scikit-learn` is used to normalize the data.
- Using the elbow method for the original scaled data with a possible k-value from 1 to 10, the best value for `k` is found to be `4`.

- The original scaled data is clustered using `KMeans` with the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d."

- Using the original scaled data, a `Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA)` is performed to reduce the features to three principal components.
    - The total explained variance for the data is `0.895031657030984`.
- Using the elbow method for the PCA data with a possible k-value from 1 to 10, the best value for `k` is found to be `4`.
